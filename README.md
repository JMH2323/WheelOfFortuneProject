# WheelOfFortuneProject

This was a personal project I took up to prove my baseline proficiency in C++
Because this interest was inspired by game development, I decided I would make a rudimentary game; however, I wanted the game to demonstrate itself in the console.
This minimal approach led to a Wheel Of Fortune game where I demonstrated some ifelse's, loops, semi-object orientation, and coding basics.
Aside from the demonstrational purpose, I had tons of fun with this one! I sat down and hammered it out in ~2 hours while fresh off familiarizing myself to C++.
